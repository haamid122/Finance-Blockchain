 Finance Blockchain 💰🔗

📌 Overview

This project is a **basic blockchain implementation in Python** for the **finance domain**.
It shows how blockchain can be applied to record **peer-to-peer financial transactions** in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner.

🎯 Objective

* Record financial transactions without a central authority.
* Ensure **immutability** (no double spending, no fraud).
* Provide a transparent ledger for auditing purposes.

🛠️ Features

* Add transactions between financial parties (e.g., Alice → Bob).
* Store multiple transactions inside a block.
* Use **SHA-256 hashing** to link blocks securely.
* Provide an immutable chain of transaction history.

 💻 Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Hashlib** for cryptographic hashing
* **JSON** for transaction formatting

📜 Example Transactions

* Alice sends money to Bob.
* Bob transfers money to Charlie.
* Alice pays David.


✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be applied in the **finance sector** to make transactions:

* **Secure** (tamper-proof ledger).
* **Transparent** (open and auditable).
* **Decentralized** (no single authority required).

Blockchain has the potential to **revolutionize finance**, making peer-to-peer transactions more trustworthy and efficient.
