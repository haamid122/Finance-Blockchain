Domain: Finance
Problem: Secure & Transparent Peer-to-Peer Transactions

Traditional finance relies on banks (centralized), which can cause issues:

High transaction fees.

Fraud or double spending.

Lack of transparency.

Blockchain Solution: A decentralized ledger for transactions between users:

Each transaction is verified and stored in a block.

No central authority needed.

Immutable and transparent history of payments.


How This Solves the Problem in Finance

No Double Spending → Every transaction is chained and verified.

Transparency → Anyone can audit the ledger of payments.

Security → Each block’s hash ensures immutability.

Decentralization → No single bank controls the records.
